A RealTime Chat Application

Im going to use `React` on the Front End, with `NodeJS` + `Socket.io` web socket library on the backend.

By the end of this project, i have a strong understanding of how to send & receive messages using web sockets and Socket.io to make any realtime application

Setup:
run `npm install` && `npm start` for both client and server side to start the development server
